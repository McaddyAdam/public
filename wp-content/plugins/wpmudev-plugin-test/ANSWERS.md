1. Package Optimization

Answer:
The large plugin ZIP file was primarily caused by bundling unnecessary development dependencies and unminified JavaScript/CSS assets. To reduce package size:

I moved development-only dependencies (e.g., testing libraries, build tools) out of the production build.

I minified and concatenated JavaScript and CSS files where appropriate.

I ensured only the required assets for functionality were included in the final plugin ZIP.

Outcome: The optimized package is significantly smaller while retaining full functionality.

2. Google Drive Admin Interface (React Implementation)
2.1 Internationalization & UI State Management

Answer:

All user-facing strings were wrapped using WordPress i18n functions (__(), _e(), esc_html__()) for translation readiness.

Conditional rendering ensures that credential input fields appear only when credentials are missing or invalid, and the authentication button changes based on the login state.

2.2 Credentials Management

Answer:

Client ID and Client Secret input fields are displayed dynamically.

The required redirect URI and OAuth scopes (drive.file, drive.readonly) are displayed to guide users.

Credentials are securely stored in WordPress options with encryption applied using openssl_encrypt() and openssl_decrypt() for added security.

All input is sanitized and validated before saving via the /wp-json/wpmudev/v1/drive/save-credentials endpoint.

2.3 Authentication Flow

Answer:

The “Authenticate with Google Drive” button initiates the OAuth 2.0 flow.

Authorization URLs are generated with the required scopes, and tokens are stored securely.

Error handling covers invalid credentials, token expiry, and access denial, with clear success/error notifications in the admin interface.

2.4 File Operations Interface

Answer:

Users can upload files to Drive with validation on file type and size, and upload progress is displayed.

New folders can be created with input validation and success/error feedback.

Drive files and folders are displayed in a clean table with:

Name, type, size, modified date

Download buttons for files

“View in Drive” links for all items

Loading states and automatic refresh after actions ensure a smooth user experience.

3. Backend: Credentials Storage Endpoint

Answer:

The endpoint /wp-json/wpmudev/v1/drive/save-credentials validates, sanitizes, and encrypts credentials.

Permissions checks ensure only users with the manage_options capability can save credentials.

JSON responses indicate success or error with descriptive messages.

4. Backend: Google Drive Authentication

Answer:

OAuth 2.0 authorization URLs are generated with the required scopes.

The callback securely stores access and refresh tokens in the database.

Token refresh logic automatically updates expired tokens.

Comprehensive error handling ensures failed authorizations are clearly communicated.

5. Backend: Files List API

Answer:

Connects to Google Drive API using stored credentials.

Returns files with name, type, size, and modified date.

Pagination is implemented to handle large drives efficiently.

Errors from the API are handled gracefully with descriptive messages.

6. Backend: File Upload Implementation

Answer:

Supports multipart uploads to Google Drive.

Validates file types and size before upload.

Tracks upload progress and provides completion/error notifications.

Ensures cleanup of temporary files after upload.

7. Posts Maintenance Admin Page

Answer:

The Posts Maintenance page provides a “Scan Posts” button that iterates over all public posts/pages.

Updates wpmudev_test_last_scan post meta with the current timestamp for each processed post.

Users can filter by post type.

Background processing ensures the scan continues even if the admin navigates away.

A scheduled daily cron job is implemented to automate scans, with progress and completion notifications in the UI.

8. WP-CLI Integration

Answer:

A WP-CLI command wp wpmudev scan-posts executes the same functionality as the admin interface.

Users can specify post types with parameters, e.g., wp wpmudev scan-posts --post_type=page,post.

The command outputs progress in the terminal and a summary at completion.

Help text and usage examples are included:

wp wpmudev scan-posts --help
wp wpmudev scan-posts --post_type=post,page

9. Dependency Management & Compatibility

Answer:

Namespaces and class prefixes were used to avoid conflicts with other plugins/themes.

Composer packages are scoped to the plugin namespace, preventing version conflicts.

Any global dependencies are minimized, and local copies of libraries are used to isolate the plugin.

All dependencies and reasoning are documented in the README.

10. Unit Testing Implementation

Answer:

PHPUnit tests cover the Posts Maintenance functionality, including:

Correct post meta updates

Handling of different post types and statuses

Edge cases (no posts, filtered post types)

Tests are independent, repeatable, and follow WordPress testing best practices.

Test results confirm functionality works as expected and does not affect unrelated posts.
